# Documentation Writer Agent Playbook

## Mission
Describe how the documentation writer agent supports the team and when to engage it.

## Responsibilities
- Create clear, comprehensive documentation
- Update existing documentation as code changes
- Write helpful code comments and examples
- Maintain README and API documentation

## Best Practices
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code
- Write from the user's perspective
- Include practical examples

## Key Project Resources
- Documentation index: [docs/README.md](../docs/README.md)
- Agent handbook: [agents/README.md](./README.md)
- Agent knowledge base: [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md)
- Contributor guide: [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Repository Starting Points
- `__pycache__/` — This directory contains compiled Python bytecode files (.pyc) generated by the Python interpreter to speed up module loading. It is automatically created during runtime and should be ignored in version control (e.g., added to .gitignore).
- `docs/` — Contains the project's core documentation in Markdown format, including guides on architecture, workflows, testing, and contributor resources to help developers understand and contribute to the project.
- `docs-web/` — Houses web-specific documentation assets, such as static site files, generated HTML outputs, or resources for hosting documentation online (e.g., via tools like MkDocs or Sphinx).

## Documentation Touchpoints

- [Project Overview](../docs/project-overview.md) — agent-update:project-overview
- [Architecture Notes](../docs/architecture.md) — agent-update:architecture-notes
- [Development Workflow](../docs/development-workflow.md) — agent-update:development-workflow
- [Testing Strategy](../docs/testing-strategy.md) — agent-update:testing-strategy
- [Glossary & Domain Concepts](../docs/glossary.md) — agent-update:glossary
- [Data Flow & Integrations](../docs/data-flow.md) — agent-update:data-flow
- [Security & Compliance Notes](../docs/security.md) — agent-update:security
- [Tooling & Productivity Guide](../docs/tooling.md) — agent-update:tooling

## Collaboration Checklist
1. Confirm assumptions with issue reporters or maintainers.
2. Review open pull requests affecting this area.
3. Update the relevant doc section listed above and remove any resolved `agent-fill` placeholders.
4. Capture learnings back in [docs/README.md](../docs/README.md) or the appropriate task marker.

## Success Metrics
Track effectiveness of this agent's contributions:
- **Code Quality:** Reduced bug count, improved test coverage, decreased technical debt
- **Velocity:** Time to complete typical tasks, deployment frequency
- **Documentation:** Coverage of features, accuracy of guides, usage by team
- **Collaboration:** PR review turnaround time, feedback quality, knowledge sharing

**Target Metrics:**
- Ensure 100% of new features and major code changes have corresponding documentation updates within 1 week of merge.
- Achieve documentation accuracy score above 95% based on quarterly team reviews or user feedback surveys.
- Track trends over time to identify improvement areas, such as using tools like documentation coverage analyzers (e.g., doctoc or custom scripts) and monitoring feedback in issues/PRs.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues
Document frequent problems this agent encounters and their solutions:

### Issue: [Common Problem]
**Symptoms:** Describe what indicates this problem
**Root Cause:** Why this happens
**Resolution:** Step-by-step fix
**Prevention:** How to avoid in the future

**Example:**
### Issue: Build Failures Due to Outdated Dependencies
**Symptoms:** Tests fail with module resolution errors
**Root Cause:** Package versions incompatible with codebase
**Resolution:**
1. Review package.json for version ranges
2. Run `npm update` to get compatible versions
3. Test locally before committing
**Prevention:** Keep dependencies updated regularly, use lockfiles

### Issue: Outdated Documentation After Code Changes
**Symptoms:** Users report confusion, errors, or outdated instructions in guides
**Root Cause:** Documentation not updated in sync with recent code commits or feature releases
**Resolution:**
1. Review recent git commits and PRs affecting the documented area (e.g., `git log --oneline -10`).
2. Identify impacted sections in docs and update with current code examples, diagrams, or workflows.
3. Validate changes by cross-referencing with running the code or tests.
4. Submit a PR for the doc updates and notify maintainers.
**Prevention:** Integrate doc reviews into code PR processes (e.g., via checklists) and use automation like CI checks for doc-build validation.

## Hand-off Notes
Summarize outcomes, remaining risks, and suggested follow-up actions after the agent completes its work.

## Evidence to Capture
- Reference commits, issues, or ADRs used to justify updates.
- Command output or logs that informed recommendations.
- Follow-up items for maintainers or future agent runs.
- Performance metrics and benchmarks where applicable.
