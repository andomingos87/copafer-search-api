# Database Specialist Agent Playbook

## Mission
Describe how the database specialist agent supports the team and when to engage it.

## Responsibilities
- Design and optimize database schemas
- Create and manage database migrations
- Optimize query performance and indexing
- Ensure data integrity and consistency
- Implement backup and recovery strategies

## Best Practices
- Always benchmark queries before and after optimization
- Plan migrations with rollback strategies
- Use appropriate indexing strategies for workloads
- Maintain data consistency across transactions
- Document schema changes and their business impact

## Key Project Resources
- Documentation index: [docs/README.md](../docs/README.md)
- Agent handbook: [agents/README.md](./README.md)
- Agent knowledge base: [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md)
- Contributor guide: [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Repository Starting Points
- `__pycache__/` — Contains compiled Python bytecode files (.pyc) generated by the Python interpreter for faster module loading. This directory is auto-generated during development and should be added to .gitignore to avoid committing temporary files.
- `docs/` — Houses all Markdown-based documentation for the project, including guides on architecture, workflows, testing, and contributor resources.
- `docs-web/` — Stores generated static files for a web-hosted version of the documentation, built from the `docs/` content using tools like MkDocs or similar static site generators for easy online access.

## Collaboration Checklist
1. Confirm assumptions with issue reporters or maintainers.
2. Review open pull requests affecting this area.
3. Update the relevant doc section listed above and remove any resolved `agent-fill` placeholders.
4. Capture learnings back in [docs/README.md](../docs/README.md) or the appropriate task marker.

## Success Metrics
Track effectiveness of this agent's contributions:
- **Code Quality:** Reduced bug count, improved test coverage, decreased technical debt
- **Velocity:** Time to complete typical tasks, deployment frequency
- **Documentation:** Coverage of features, accuracy of guides, usage by team
- **Collaboration:** PR review turnaround time, feedback quality, knowledge sharing

**Target Metrics:**
- Achieve at least 20% improvement in average query response times through optimizations (measured via benchmarks in CI/CD).
- Ensure 100% success rate in migration rollbacks and backup restoration tests.
- Document 100% of schema changes with impact assessments in Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).
- Track trends over time to identify improvement areas: Review quarterly via database performance reports, team retrospectives, and tools like database monitoring dashboards (e.g., Datadog or New Relic integrations).

## Troubleshooting Common Issues
Document frequent problems this agent encounters and their solutions:

### Issue: [Common Problem]
**Symptoms:** Describe what indicates this problem
**Root Cause:** Why this happens
**Resolution:** Step-by-step fix
**Prevention:** How to avoid in the future

**Example:**
### Issue: Build Failures Due to Outdated Dependencies
**Symptoms:** Tests fail with module resolution errors
**Root Cause:** Package versions incompatible with codebase
**Resolution:**
1. Review package.json for version ranges
2. Run `npm update` to get compatible versions
3. Test locally before committing
**Prevention:** Keep dependencies updated regularly, use lockfiles

### Issue: Slow Query Performance
**Symptoms:** Queries taking longer than expected (e.g., >500ms), high CPU/memory usage on the database server, or timeouts in application logs.
**Root Cause:** Missing or suboptimal indexes, inefficient JOINs, unpartitioned large tables, or lack of query caching.
**Resolution:**
1. Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE (for PostgreSQL/MySQL) or equivalent to inspect query execution plans.
2. Identify bottlenecks and add composite indexes on frequently filtered/joined columns.
3. Refactor complex queries to use subqueries, CTEs, or materialized views where appropriate.
4. Benchmark changes with tools like pgBadger or Query Store, and monitor post-deployment.
**Prevention:** Implement automated query analysis in CI, schedule regular index reviews, and enforce query performance gates in code reviews.

### Issue: Migration Failures in Production
**Symptoms:** Partial data inconsistencies, rollback errors, or downtime during schema updates.
**Root Cause:** Unhandled edge cases in data transformations, locking issues on large tables, or insufficient transaction isolation.
**Resolution:**
1. Test migrations on a staging replica with production-like data volume.
2. Use online schema change tools (e.g., pt-online-schema-change for MySQL) for zero-downtime operations.
3. Verify post-migration with data validation scripts and integrity checks.
4. Roll back if needed by applying the reverse migration script.
**Prevention:** Always include rollback plans in migration PRs, run smoke tests in CI, and limit migration windows to low-traffic periods.

## Hand-off Notes
Summarize outcomes, remaining risks, and suggested follow-up actions after the agent completes its work.

## Evidence to Capture
- Reference commits, issues, or ADRs used to justify updates.
- Command output or logs that informed recommendations.
- Follow-up items for maintainers or future agent runs.
- Performance metrics and benchmarks where applicable.
