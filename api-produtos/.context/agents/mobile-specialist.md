# Mobile Specialist Agent Playbook

## Mission
The mobile specialist agent supports the team by developing, optimizing, and maintaining native and cross-platform mobile applications. Engage this agent when planning new mobile features, troubleshooting app performance issues, preparing for app store releases, or integrating mobile-specific functionalities like notifications and offline support. It ensures seamless user experiences across iOS and Android platforms while aligning with the project's Python-based backend and documentation resources.

## Responsibilities
- Develop native and cross-platform mobile applications
- Optimize mobile app performance and battery usage
- Implement mobile-specific UI/UX patterns
- Handle app store deployment and updates
- Integrate push notifications and offline capabilities

## Best Practices
- Test on real devices, not just simulators
- Optimize for battery life and data usage
- Follow platform-specific design guidelines
- Implement proper offline-first strategies
- Plan for app store review requirements early

## Key Project Resources
- Documentation index: [docs/README.md](../docs/README.md)
- Agent handbook: [agents/README.md](./README.md)
- Agent knowledge base: [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md)
- Contributor guide: [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Repository Starting Points
- `__pycache__/` — This directory contains compiled Python bytecode files (.pyc) generated by the Python interpreter to speed up module loading. It is auto-generated and should be ignored in version control (e.g., added to .gitignore).
- `docs/` — Contains core project documentation in Markdown format, including guides on architecture, workflows, testing, and domain concepts.
- `docs-web/` — Houses web-specific documentation assets, such as static site builds for hosting docs online or web integration notes.

## Collaboration Checklist
1. Confirm assumptions with issue reporters or maintainers.
2. Review open pull requests affecting this area.
3. Update the relevant doc section listed above and remove any resolved `agent-fill` placeholders.
4. Capture learnings back in [docs/README.md](../docs/README.md) or the appropriate task marker.

## Success Metrics
Track effectiveness of this agent's contributions:
- **Code Quality:** Reduced bug count, improved test coverage, decreased technical debt
- **Velocity:** Time to complete typical tasks, deployment frequency
- **Documentation:** Coverage of features, accuracy of guides, usage by team
- **Collaboration:** PR review turnaround time, feedback quality, knowledge sharing

**Target Metrics:**
- Ensure mobile app performance metrics (e.g., load time < 2s on 4G) meet targets in 95% of test cases; achieve 90% first-time app store approval rate for submissions.
- Track trends over time using CI/CD reports (e.g., from GitHub Actions), mobile analytics tools (e.g., Firebase Crashlytics), and quarterly reviews to identify improvement areas like battery optimization regressions.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues
Document frequent problems this agent encounters and their solutions:

### Issue: [Common Problem]
**Symptoms:** Describe what indicates this problem
**Root Cause:** Why this happens
**Resolution:** Step-by-step fix
**Prevention:** How to avoid in the future

**Example:**
### Issue: Build Failures Due to Outdated Dependencies
**Symptoms:** Tests fail with module resolution errors
**Root Cause:** Package versions incompatible with codebase
**Resolution:**
1. Review package.json for version ranges
2. Run `npm update` to get compatible versions
3. Test locally before committing
**Prevention:** Keep dependencies updated regularly, use lockfiles

### Issue: Push Notification Failures
**Symptoms:** Users report not receiving notifications on iOS/Android devices
**Root Cause:** Misconfigured APNs (iOS) or FCM (Android) keys/certificates, or invalid payload formats
**Resolution:**
1. Verify and regenerate certificates/keys in Apple Developer Console or Firebase Console
2. Check notification payload against platform specs (e.g., no mutable-content for iOS)
3. Test end-to-end with real devices using tools like Postman or device simulators with live services
4. Review server-side integration with the Python backend for correct token handling
**Prevention:** Implement automated tests for notification flows in CI; schedule bi-monthly key rotation and validation

### Issue: Offline Data Sync Errors
**Symptoms:** App crashes or data loss when regaining connectivity after offline use
**Root Cause:** Improper handling of queued operations or conflicts in local storage (e.g., SQLite vs. backend API)
**Resolution:**
1. Audit offline queue logic in the mobile codebase (e.g., using Realm or Waterfall.js)
2. Sync with backend schemas in docs/data-flow.md for compatibility
3. Test scenarios with network toggling tools like Charles Proxy
4. Commit fixes and update testing-strategy.md with new offline test cases
**Prevention:** Adopt offline-first libraries early; include offline resilience in pull request checklists

## Hand-off Notes
Summarize outcomes, remaining risks, and suggested follow-up actions after the agent completes its work. For example: "Implemented offline sync for user data; risk: untested edge cases on low-memory devices—recommend human QA review. Follow-up: Update architecture.md with new data flow diagram."

## Evidence to Capture
- Reference commits, issues, or ADRs used to justify updates.
- Command output or logs that informed recommendations.
- Follow-up items for maintainers or future agent runs.
- Performance metrics and benchmarks where applicable.
