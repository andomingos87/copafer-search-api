# Test Writer Agent Playbook

## Mission
Describe how the test writer agent supports the team and when to engage it.

## Responsibilities
- Write comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Ensure good test coverage across the codebase
- Create test utilities and fixtures
- Maintain and update existing tests

## Best Practices
- Write tests that are clear and maintainable
- Test both happy path and edge cases
- Use descriptive test names

## Key Project Resources
- Documentation index: [docs/README.md](../docs/README.md)
- Agent handbook: [agents/README.md](./README.md)
- Agent knowledge base: [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md)
- Contributor guide: [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Repository Starting Points
- `__pycache__/` — Contains compiled Python bytecode files (.pyc) generated by the Python interpreter to cache and speed up module loading on subsequent runs. This directory is auto-generated and should not be committed to version control.
- `docs/` — Houses the core project documentation in Markdown format, including guides on architecture, workflows, testing strategies, and contributor resources.
- `docs-web/` — Stores web-optimized or static site versions of the documentation, potentially generated from the `docs/` content for hosting on platforms like GitHub Pages or a documentation server.

## Collaboration Checklist
1. Confirm assumptions with issue reporters or maintainers.
2. Review open pull requests affecting this area.
3. Update the relevant doc section listed above and remove any resolved `agent-fill` placeholders.
4. Capture learnings back in [docs/README.md](../docs/README.md) or the appropriate task marker.

## Success Metrics
Track effectiveness of this agent's contributions:
- **Code Quality:** Reduced bug count, improved test coverage, decreased technical debt
- **Velocity:** Time to complete typical tasks, deployment frequency
- **Documentation:** Coverage of features, accuracy of guides, usage by team
- **Collaboration:** PR review turnaround time, feedback quality, knowledge sharing

**Target Metrics:**
- Achieve at least 80% unit test coverage for new code contributions
- Ensure all new features include integration tests covering key scenarios
- Track trends over time using tools like coverage.py reports and GitHub issue trackers to identify and address coverage gaps or recurring test failures

## Troubleshooting Common Issues
Document frequent problems this agent encounters and their solutions:

### Issue: [Common Problem]
**Symptoms:** Describe what indicates this problem
**Root Cause:** Why this happens
**Resolution:** Step-by-step fix
**Prevention:** How to avoid in the future

**Example:**
### Issue: Build Failures Due to Outdated Dependencies
**Symptoms:** Tests fail with module resolution errors
**Root Cause:** Package versions incompatible with codebase
**Resolution:**
1. Review package.json for version ranges
2. Run `npm update` to get compatible versions
3. Test locally before committing
**Prevention:** Keep dependencies updated regularly, use lockfiles

### Issue: Flaky Tests Due to Race Conditions
**Symptoms:** Tests pass intermittently in CI but fail locally or vice versa
**Root Cause:** Asynchronous operations or shared resources not properly mocked or isolated
**Resolution:**
1. Identify the failing test and reproduce the issue locally
2. Add explicit waits, mocks, or fixtures to isolate the test environment
3. Refactor to use deterministic setups, e.g., pytest fixtures for database resets
4. Run tests with `--runslow` or increased timeouts in CI
**Prevention:** Follow the testing strategy guidelines for mocking external dependencies and use tools like pytest-rerunfailures for CI retries

## Hand-off Notes
Summarize outcomes, remaining risks, and suggested follow-up actions after the agent completes its work.

## Evidence to Capture
- Reference commits, issues, or ADRs used to justify updates.
- Command output or logs that informed recommendations.
- Follow-up items for maintainers or future agent runs.
- Performance metrics and benchmarks where applicable.
