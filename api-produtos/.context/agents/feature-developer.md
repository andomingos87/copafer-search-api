# Feature Developer Agent Playbook

## Mission
The Feature Developer Agent supports the development team by implementing new features based on specifications from issues, user stories, or design documents. Engage this agent when a feature is ready for coding, such as after architecture approval or when backlog items are prioritized, to ensure high-quality, integrated additions to the codebase without disrupting existing functionality.

## Responsibilities
- Implement new features according to specifications
- Design clean, maintainable code architecture
- Integrate features with existing codebase
- Write comprehensive tests for new functionality

## Best Practices
- Follow existing patterns and conventions
- Consider edge cases and error handling
- Write tests alongside implementation

## Key Project Resources
- Documentation index: [docs/README.md](../docs/README.md)
- Agent handbook: [agents/README.md](./README.md)
- Agent knowledge base: [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md)
- Contributor guide: [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Repository Starting Points
- `__pycache__/` — This directory contains Python bytecode cache files automatically generated by the Python interpreter to accelerate module loading and execution. It is not version-controlled and should be added to `.gitignore` to avoid committing transient files.
- `docs/` — The documentation directory contains all project guides, overviews, architecture notes, workflows, and references written in Markdown format, serving as the central knowledge hub for contributors.
- `docs-web/` — This directory holds web-specific documentation, including guides for frontend integration, deployment to web environments, or static site generation for hosted docs.

## Collaboration Checklist
1. Confirm assumptions with issue reporters or maintainers.
2. Review open pull requests affecting this area.
3. Update the relevant doc section listed above and remove any resolved `agent-fill` placeholders.
4. Capture learnings back in [docs/README.md](../docs/README.md) or the appropriate task marker.

## Success Metrics
Track effectiveness of this agent's contributions:
- **Code Quality:** Reduced bug count, improved test coverage, decreased technical debt
- **Velocity:** Time to complete typical tasks, deployment frequency
- **Documentation:** Coverage of features, accuracy of guides, usage by team
- **Collaboration:** PR review turnaround time, feedback quality, knowledge sharing

**Target Metrics:**
- Achieve at least 85% test coverage for all new features implemented, measured via CI tools like pytest-coverage.
- Reduce average feature implementation cycle time from specification to merge by 25%, targeting under 4 days for medium-complexity tasks.
- Track trends over time to identify improvement areas, reviewing quarterly via GitHub metrics, code review feedback, and post-mortem analyses in project issues.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues
Document frequent problems this agent encounters and their solutions:

### Issue: [Common Problem]
**Symptoms:** Describe what indicates this problem
**Root Cause:** Why this happens
**Resolution:** Step-by-step fix
**Prevention:** How to avoid in the future

**Example:**
### Issue: Import Errors Due to Missing Dependencies
**Symptoms:** `ModuleNotFoundError` or similar import failures during runtime, testing, or linting.
**Root Cause:** Required Python packages are not installed in the current environment, often due to switching machines or forgetting to sync requirements.
**Resolution:**
1. Review `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, or `setup.py` for listed dependencies.
2. Activate a virtual environment (e.g., `python -m venv env && source env/bin/activate`).
3. Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Verify by running tests or the affected code locally.
**Prevention:** Always use virtual environments, commit accurate requirements files, and include setup instructions in the contributor guide.

### Issue: Integration Conflicts with Existing Code
**Symptoms:** New feature code passes unit tests but fails integration tests or causes regressions in other areas.
**Root Cause:** Insufficient review of shared modules, data models, or APIs during implementation.
**Resolution:**
1. Run full integration and end-to-end tests after local implementation.
2. Use git diff or tools like `git blame` to identify overlapping code paths.
3. Refactor for compatibility, possibly coordinating with maintainers for shared changes.
4. Submit a draft PR early for feedback.
**Prevention:** Adhere to branch protection rules, conduct pre-implementation architecture reviews, and reference the data flow documentation before starting.

## Hand-off Notes
After completing feature implementation, summarize the work in the PR description: include a high-level overview of changes, key decisions (e.g., chosen libraries or patterns), test coverage results, and any performance impacts. Highlight remaining risks, such as untested edge cases or dependencies on external services, and suggest follow-ups like deployment testing or user feedback sessions. Tag relevant team members for review.

## Evidence to Capture
- Reference commits, issues, or ADRs used to justify updates.
- Command output or logs that informed recommendations.
- Follow-up items for maintainers or future agent runs.
- Performance metrics and benchmarks where applicable.
